### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

https://gitlab.com/ellman12

I am a student at Dakota State University, working towards my Bachelor's/Master's in Computer Science.<br>
Expected to graduate with Bachelor's in May 2023, and the following year for the Master's.<br>
In my spare time I work on my [Photos Storage Server](https://github.com/ellman12/Photos-Storage-Server) project, as well as my [AutoHotkey scripts](https://github.com/ellman12/AutoHotkey).<br>
I am learning SQL, Python 3, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C#.<br>
I have experience with Java, AutoHotkey, and C/C++.<br>
I try to automate repetitive tasks and streamline my workflow and make it as efficient as possible. AutoHotkey really helps with this.<br>
I was on my high school's FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team for 5 years as the lead (Java) programmer.<br>
