<!--
In middle school, Lego Mindstorms took over my life and ignited my love for programming and robotics. In high school, Java and AutoHotkey further developed this, and made me passionate about efficiency and automation. In college, I fell in love with C#, and Unity led me to discover my love for game design. Lately, I've been exploring Godot, and _loving_ it. Continuous learning is part of my core philosophy, so I'm always on the lookout for new technologies to try!
