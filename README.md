My name is Elliott DuCharme. I graduated from Dakota State University with my B.S. in Computer Science. Currently, I'm working at KBR as a software engineer.

In high school, FRC and AutoHotkey took over my life and made me fall in love with programming and automation. In college, C# and Unity did the same, leading me to discover my love for game design. Lately, I've been exploring Godot, and _loving_ it. Continuous learning is part of my core philosophy, so I'm always on the lookout for new technologies to try!

I have experience with a wide variety of programming languages and frameworks:<br>
C#, TypeScript, React, Next.js, SQL, Unity, Godot, C, C++, Java, AutoHotkey, and Python.
