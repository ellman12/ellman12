My name is Elliott DuCharme. I recently graduated from Dakota State University with my Bachelor's in Computer Science. Currently, I'm working at KBR in Sioux Falls, SD as a software engineer.

I was on my high school's FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team for five years, where I discovered my love of programming and problem solving. In my last three years, I took on the role of lead Java programmer and also mentored the younger team members.

During my last two years of high school, I stumbled upon AutoHotkey and immediately developed a deep passion for efficiency, optimization, and automation in both computers and everyday life. Alongside that, I have a strong passion for organization, especially after the end of Google Photos' unlimited tier, which sparked my fascination with photo and video metadata and organization, and which ultimately led to me creating MemoryMosaic.

During my spare time, I work on side projects like [MemoryMosaic](https://github.com/ellman12/MemoryMosaic), my photo and video manager, as well as my [AutoHotkey scripts](https://github.com/ellman12/AutoHotkey-V2). These two projects might be my magnum opus. I have also recently started working with Unity.

I have experience with a variety of programming languages, including C, C++, C# (easily my favorite), Unity, Python, Java, AutoHotkey, SQL, HTML, CSS, Assembly, JavaScript, and PHP.
